<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


![aa-homepage-image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73206753/162338698-f42dab4d-c0a8-4792-9f73-eff9536b8191.png)

An application that provides its users with the ability to find information about their favorite anime and manga and organize them in a user personalized list. 


**Objectives:** 
* Create MERN application from scratch that utilizes an external public API
* Gain experience in session-cookie based user-authentication
* Solidify MVC architectural principles to better organize and structure code
* Experiment with different methods of deployment


**Link to project:** https://anime-archive.netlify.app/


### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
* [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
* [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/)


## Getting Started


First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To start the client in development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

Or for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


**Note:** The client can run independently from the server. The only features you will not be able to manage are anything related to user creation and authentication (registration, login, user anime list, etc...). The server will only function if the DB_STRING and SESSION_SECRET variables are set in your .env file. It is recommended to peruse the deployed application (https://anime-archive.netlify.app/) instead of trying to get the application running on your local machine.  

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage


### Summary
An application that provides its users with the ability to find information about their favorite anime and manga and organize them in a user personalized list.    


### Walkthrough


* Homepage uses react states and refs to implement lazy skeleton loading upon scroll to a particular element on the page in order to circumvent the rate-limitation of the Jikan API.
* The Swiper library was also used to create the carousels that are "swipable" on touch-screen devices. 

![aa-home-page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73206753/162072871-f7d62e42-525c-40e6-872d-d8504da2d969.gif)




* Reusable components were recycled in various pages. 
* E.g. List component as shown below renders a grid layout of media elements with infinite scroll functionality on the browse page. 

![aa-browse-page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73206753/162075224-4cd63406-021b-4b56-bb76-f4e8c085e1da.gif)



* The various hooks that the React API provides allows condtional API calls upon state changes. 
* An example of this is on the seasonal page where upon selection of a different season, the page dynamically renders using a different set of data received from the Jikan API. 
* Functional programming constructs were used clientside to filter the data in the response to sort them according to certain parameters.

* The search page can filter results by multiple parameters including genre, type, status, rating and also sort these results by score, popularity, title, and rank.

* A more general search bar also exists on the top-nav that searches for anime, manga, and/or characters associated with the inputed query.

* A MVC structured REST API was created using Node, MongoDB and Mongoose to accomodate for Jikan API's lack of CRUD functionality in regards to user information and data.
* Information validation for registration uses REGEX clientside and passport's local strategy serverside. 
* Encryption of sensitive information performed using Node's Crypto library
* User authentication to access protected routes utilizes session-cookie based authentication.

* User anime list has full CRUD functionality.

* User list can also be filtered

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Make Mobile Responsive
- [ ] Implement cloud storage for images for profile custimization
- [ ] Allow lists to be created for Manga and Characters
- [ ] Horizontal Load balancing 



See the [open issues](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).


## Optimizations

<!-- You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews! -->

**Implemented:**
* Lazy loading of components allowed for a lower perceived loading time and reduced the number of API requests per second to accomodate for the rate-limitation of the Jikan API. 
* Divided code in certain pages to separate react components to prevent the entire page from reloading on state changes on that specific component. Many of these components were also reused in various pages on the application.   


**Potential:**
* This project serves only as a showcase. If the application was intended to go live and expect higher web loads, horizontal scaling through multiple deployments of the server should be implemented. 
* NGINX can also be used as a load-balancer if performance needs to be further improved.
* Database indexing and caching may also be used if data capacity grows too large.
* Global state management (e.g. React Context or Redux) has the potential to significantly reduce redundant code 


## Lessons Learned:

<!-- No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing. -->

* First time working with a rate-limiting API. Ultimately decided to employ lazy loading of components to reduce the number of immediate API requests. 
* Gained a much better understanding of how session-cookie based user authentication worked and how to debug cookie related issues. 
* Worked with more complex conditional logic, especially in relation to state dependent conditional CSS rendering of styled components.
